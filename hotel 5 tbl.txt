Sure, here's an example of how to create a hotel management system database using MySQL with 5 tables:

1. Create the database and tables:

CREATE DATABASE hotel_management;

USE hotel_management;

CREATE TABLE guests (
  guest_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  phone_number VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE rooms (
  room_number INT PRIMARY KEY,
  room_type VARCHAR(50),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  max_occupancy INT
);

CREATE TABLE reservations (
  reservation_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  guest_id INT,
  room_number INT,
  check_in_date DATE,
  check_out_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (guest_id) REFERENCES guests(guest_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (room_number) REFERENCES rooms(room_number)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  phone_number VARCHAR(20),
  hire_date DATE,
  job_title VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE shifts (
  shift_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id INT,
  start_time TIME,
  end_time TIME,
  shift_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);


2. Enforce referential integrity on related tables:

In the above example, referential integrity is enforced by adding foreign key constraints to the reservations and shifts tables that reference the guests and employees tables. This ensures that a reservation or shift cannot be created for a guest or employee that does not exist in the respective tables.

3. Perform join operation on two tables:

To perform a join operation on the reservations and guests tables, you can use the following query:

SELECT reservations.reservation_id, guests.first_name, guests.last_name, reservations.check_in_date, reservations.check_out_date
FROM reservations
INNER JOIN guests ON reservations.guest_id = guests.guest_id;


This will return a result set that includes the reservation ID, guest first and last name, and check-in and check-out dates for each reservation.
