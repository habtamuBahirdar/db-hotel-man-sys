Sure, here's an example of how to create a hotel management system database using MySQL with 5 tables, example data, and join operations:

1. Create the database and tables with example data:

CREATE DATABASE hotel_management;

USE hotel_management;

CREATE TABLE guests (
  guest_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  phone_number VARCHAR(20)
);

INSERT INTO guests (guest_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'johndoe@example.com', '555-1234'),
       (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'janesmith@example.com', '555-5678'),
       (3, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'bobjohnson@example.com', '555-9012');

CREATE TABLE rooms (
  room_number INT PRIMARY KEY,
  room_type VARCHAR(50),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  max_occupancy INT
);

INSERT INTO rooms (room_number, room_type, price, max_occupancy)
VALUES (101, 'Standard', 100.00, 2),
       (102, 'Standard', 100.00, 2),
       (103, 'Deluxe', 150.00, 4),
       (104, 'Suite', 250.00, 6);

CREATE TABLE reservations (
  reservation_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  guest_id INT,
  room_number INT,
  check_in_date DATE,
  check_out_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (guest_id) REFERENCES guests(guest_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (room_number) REFERENCES rooms(room_number)
);

INSERT INTO reservations (reservation_id, guest_id, room_number, check_in_date, check_out_date)
VALUES (1, 1, 101, '2022-01-01', '2022-01-03'),
       (2, 2, 103, '2022-01-02', '2022-01-05'),
       (3, 3, 104, '2022-01-03', '2022-01-06');

CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  phone_number VARCHAR(20),
  hire_date DATE,
  job_title VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, hire_date, job_title, salary)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Johnson', 'alicejohnson@example.com', '555-1111', '2021-01-01', 'Front Desk Clerk', 25000.00),
       (2, 'Bob', 'Smith', 'bobsmith@example.com', '555-2222', '2021-02-01', 'Housekeeper', 20000.00),
       (3, 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'charliebrown@example.com', '555-3333', '2021-03-01', 'Manager', 50000.00);

CREATE TABLE shifts (
  shift_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id INT,
  start_time TIME,
  end_time TIME,
  shift_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);

INSERT INTO shifts (shift_id, employee_id, start_time, end_time, shift_date)
VALUES (1, 1, '08:00:00', '16:00:00', '2022-01-01'),
       (2, 2, '09:00:00', '17:00:00', '2022-01-01'),
       (3, 3, '10:00:00', '18:00:00', '2022-01-01');


2. Enforce referential integrity on related tables:

In the above example, referential integrity is enforced by adding foreign key constraints to the reservations and shifts tables that reference the guests and employees tables. This ensures that a reservation or shift cannot be created for a guest or employee that does not exist in the respective tables.

3. Perform join operations on two tables:

finish the code

ChatGPT OpenAI Bot, [6/24/2023 12:14 PM]
on the reservations and guests tables, you can use the following query:

SELECT reservations.reservation_id, guests.first_name, guests.last_name, reservations.check_in_date, reservations.check_out_date
FROM reservations
INNER JOIN guests ON reservations.guest_id = guests.guest_id;


This will return a result set that includes the reservation ID, guest first and last name, and check-in and check-out dates for each reservation.

To perform a join operation on the shifts and employees tables, you can use the following query:

SELECT shifts.shift_id, employees.first_name, employees.last_name, shifts.start_time, shifts.end_time, shifts.shift_date
FROM shifts
INNER JOIN employees ON shifts.employee_id = employees.employee_id;


This will return a result set that includes the shift ID, employee first and last name, start and end times, and shift date for each shift.

add left,right,right,&full join

Sure, here are examples of left, right, inner, and full outer joins using the rooms and reservations tables:

1. Left join:

SELECT rooms.room_number, rooms.room_type, reservations.check_in_date, reservations.check_out_date
FROM rooms
LEFT JOIN reservations ON rooms.room_number = reservations.room_number;


This will return a result set that includes all rooms, along with the check-in and check-out dates for any reservations that exist for each room. If a room has no reservations, the check-in and check-out dates will be NULL.

2. Right join:

SELECT rooms.room_number, rooms.room_type, reservations.check_in_date, reservations.check_out_date
FROM rooms
RIGHT JOIN reservations ON rooms.room_number = reservations.room_number;


This will return a result set that includes all reservations, along with the room number and room type for each reservation. If a reservation does not have a corresponding room, the room number and room type will be NULL.

3. Inner join:

SELECT rooms.room_number, rooms.room_type, reservations.check_in_date, reservations.check_out_date
FROM rooms
INNER JOIN reservations ON rooms.room_number = reservations.room_number;


This will return a result set that includes only the rooms that have reservations, along with the check-in and check-out dates for each reservation.

4. Full outer join:

SELECT rooms.room_number, rooms.room_type, reservations.check_in_date, reservations.check_out_date
FROM rooms
FULL OUTER JOIN reservations ON rooms.room_number = reservations.room_number;


Note that MySQL does not support full outer joins, so we can simulate it using a union of a left join and a right join:

SELECT rooms.room_number, rooms.room_type, reservations.check_in_date, reservations.check_out_date
FROM rooms
LEFT JOIN reservations ON rooms.room_number = reservations.room_number
UNION
SELECT rooms.room_number, rooms.room_type, reservations.check_in_date, reservations.check_out_date
FROM rooms
RIGHT JOIN reservations ON rooms.room_number = reservations.room_number
WHERE rooms.room_number IS NULL;


This will return a result set that includes all rooms and all reservations, with NULL values for any missing data.
